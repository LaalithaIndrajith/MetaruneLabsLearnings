# Learning & Experiments Repository

This repository contains my personal learning journey and experiments with TypeScript, Javascript and other technologies. The structure of this repository is organized into multiple folders to categorize different learning modules and experiments. Below is the folder structure:

## Folder Structure
### 1. `TypeScript/NetNinja Tutorials`

This folder contains exercises based on the [TypeScript Tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gUgr39Q_yD6v-bSyMwKPUI&si=RtXPltBz8TkgvBP-) video series by **The Net Ninja** on YouTube. The tutorials cover various aspects of TypeScript, including basic concepts, advanced features, and TypeScript integration in real-world projects.



#### Setup Instructions

To build JavaScript from TypeScript files, you need to have TypeScript installed globally on your machine. If TypeScript is not already installed, you can install it using npm with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g typescript

```
Once TypeScript is installed, you can begin compiling .ts files into JavaScript.


#### Viewing the Output

The output of the exercises in this repository is logged to the browser's console. To view the output:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Press `F12` or right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect** to open the browser's Developer Tools.
3. Navigate to the **Console** tab within the Developer Tools to see the output of the TypeScript exercises.
